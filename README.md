# PCA-Factor-Analysis
PCA + Factor Analysis for identifying trends in survey data

## Summary

This paper uses the traditional statistical methods of principal component analysis and factor analysis to 
characterize political opinions in the United States. The subject data of this paper is Pew Research 
Center’s March 2019 survey data.

## Results

Factor analysis did not produce meaningful differences from principal component analysis, so this 
section focuses on the results of factor analysis. Figures 1 through 5 shown in the appendix show the top 
contributing variables (by percent of contribution) to each of the first five principal components. 
Principal component one reveals that respondents who disapprove of how president Donald Trump is 
handling his job as president are also dissatisfied with how things are going in the country. Similarly, 
these respondents do not approve of the tax law he passed. Surprisingly, these participants tended to 
feel more positive about the dynamics of the US economy, indicating the economic system is fair to 
corporations and individuals. Principal component two reveals that a common group of people either 
did not know or refused to answer several questions related to race, religion, and taxes. Principal 
component three reveals that those who feel there is some discrimination towards blacks, Hispanics, 
and whites are also not bothered by how much certain groups pay in taxes. Principal component four 
has mixed results, featuring respondents that trust the government most of the time but are also angry 
with the government. Principal component five is also not that meaningful, featuring a lot of don’t know 
or refused responses.
